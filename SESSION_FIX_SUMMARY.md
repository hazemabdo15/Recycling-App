# JWT Session Management Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

### What was happening:
1. **User logs in successfully** → notification icon appears, profile shows user info
2. **JWT token expires after 1 minute** (as per TOKEN_CONFIG in config.js)
3. **APIService clears expired tokens** from storage but doesn't notify AuthContext
4. **AuthContext state remains unchanged** → UI still shows user as logged in
5. **Pickup scheduling fails** with "session expired" because it checks authentication real-time
6. **Profile page shows stale user info** because it loads from AsyncStorage instead of AuthContext
7. **Multiple stacked dialogs appear** when token expires due to repeated auth checks

### Root Cause:
**Inconsistent authentication state** - APIService and AuthContext were not synchronized when tokens expired, plus multiple concurrent auth checks caused dialog spam.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Token Expiration Notification System**
- Created `notifyTokenExpired()` function in AuthContext
- Modified APIService to call this function when tokens are cleared
- Now when APIService clears expired tokens, it immediately updates AuthContext state

### 2. **Added Periodic Token Validation**
- AuthContext now checks token validity every 2 minutes when user is logged in
- Added safeguards to prevent multiple simultaneous checks
- If token expires during app usage, AuthContext automatically clears the session
- This prevents stale authentication state

### 3. **Fixed Profile Data Source**
- Changed profile page to use AuthContext data instead of loading directly from AsyncStorage  
- Now profile info immediately updates when tokens expire
- Ensures consistent authentication state across all UI components

### 4. **Fixed Multiple Dialog Issue**
- Added dialog prevention logic in pickup page to prevent multiple stacked alerts
- Limited periodic token validation frequency to avoid spam
- Each auth error now shows only one dialog at a time

### 5. **Fixed Profile Logout**
- Changed from manual AsyncStorage clearing to proper AuthContext `logout()` method
- This ensures consistent logout behavior across the app

### 6. **Added Session Information Helper**
- Added `getSessionInfo()` function to AuthContext
- Provides token expiration time and remaining session duration
- Can be used to show session countdown to users

## Key Changes Made

### AuthContext.jsx
- Added global reference system for APIService communication
- Added `handleTokenExpired()` method to clear expired sessions
- Added periodic token validation (every 2 minutes with concurrency protection)
- Changed profile data loading to use AuthContext instead of direct AsyncStorage access
- Added `getSessionInfo()` helper for session details
- Exported `notifyTokenExpired()` for APIService to use

### apiService.js
- Imported `notifyTokenExpired` function from AuthContext
- Modified `clearTokens()` to notify AuthContext when tokens are cleared
- Now APIService and AuthContext stay synchronized

### profile.jsx
- Replaced manual logout with proper AuthContext `logout()` method
- Changed from AsyncStorage user loading to AuthContext user data
- Removed direct AsyncStorage manipulation
- Profile now immediately reflects authentication state changes
- Cleaner, more consistent logout flow

### pickup.jsx
- Added dialog prevention logic to avoid multiple stacked alerts
- Enhanced auth error handling with single-dialog guarantee
- Improved error state management

## Session Duration Information

Based on the configuration in `services/api/config.js`:
- **Access Token Duration**: 1 minute (60,000 ms)
- **Refresh Token Duration**: 7 days
- **Token Refresh**: Happens automatically when access token expires
- **Proactive Refresh**: Tokens are refreshed 30 seconds before expiration

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **User logs in** → Both UI and internal state are synchronized
2. **Token expiration** → AuthContext immediately clears state, UI updates
3. **Pickup scheduling** → Will properly redirect to login if session expired
4. **Profile page** → Shows accurate authentication state
5. **Logout** → Consistent across all app components

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login and wait 1-2 minutes** → UI should update to logged-out state
2. **Try pickup scheduling after token expiry** → Should show single dialog, not multiple stacked ones
3. **Check profile page after expiry** → Should immediately show guest mode
4. **Manual logout** → Should work consistently from profile page
5. **Test rapid navigation** → Should not create multiple auth dialogs

## Additional Notes

- The 1-minute token duration seems very short for production use
- Consider increasing it to 15-30 minutes for better user experience
- Refresh tokens handle longer sessions (7 days) automatically
- The system now handles token expiration gracefully without user confusion
- Periodic validation runs every 2 minutes to balance responsiveness with performance
- Dialog prevention ensures users don't get overwhelmed with multiple auth prompts

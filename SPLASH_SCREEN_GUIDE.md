   - Manages initialization process step by step
   - Handles authentication, data loading, and cart sync

3. **`app/_layout.jsx`**
   - Integrated SplashController wrapper around the app
   - Ensures splash screen shows during app initialization

4. **`app.json`**
   - Updated native splash screen background color to match theme

### Initialization Steps

1. **API Service Setup** (10%) - Initialize core API connections
2. **Authentication Verification** (30%) - Validate user session
3. **Session Validation** (50%) - Check token validity
4. **Essential Data Loading** (70%) - Load categories and items
5. **Cart Synchronization** (85%) - Sync user cart data
6. **Final Setup** (95%) - Complete initialization
7. **Welcome** (100%) - Ready to show main app

### Configuration

The splash screen automatically:

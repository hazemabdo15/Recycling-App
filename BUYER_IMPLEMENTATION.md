# Buyer Role Implementation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of buyer role support in the Recycling App, allowing users to register and login as buyers with customized UI/UX that differs from customer users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication System Updates

#### Fixed Role Registration Process
- **File**: `components/auth/RegisterForm.jsx`
  - Changed default role from 'user' to 'customer'
  - Updated picker options: "User" â†’ "Customer", kept "Buyer"

- **File**: `app/register.jsx`
  - Added role parameter to OTP navigation

- **File**: `app/otp.jsx`
  - Added role parameter handling from navigation
  - Pass role to `completeRegister` function

### 2. Role-Based Labels System

#### Created Centralized Label Management
- **File**: `utils/roleLabels.js`
  - Comprehensive mapping of role-specific text labels
  - Main differences between customer and buyer:
    - Customer: "Pickup", "Request Pickup", "Schedule Pickup"
    - Buyer: "Cart", "Place Order", "Place Order"
  - Utility functions:
    - `getLabel(key, role, params)` - Get role-specific text
    - `getProgressStepLabel(step, role)` - Get step-specific labels
    - `isBuyer(user)` and `isCustomer(user)` - Role checking helpers

### 3. Screen Updates with Role-Based Text

#### Cart Screen (`app/(tabs)/cart.jsx`)
- Added `useAuth` hook to get user role
- Updated text labels:
  - Cart title: "Your Pickup Cart" â†’ "Your Shopping Cart" (for buyers)
  - Empty state messages
  - Action buttons: "Schedule Pickup" â†’ "Place Order" (for buyers)
  - Minimum order messages

#### Pickup/Order Flow (`app/pickup.jsx`)
- Added role-based progress step labels
- Phase titles now adapt based on user role

#### Address Phase (`components/pickup/AddressPhase.jsx`)
- Updated "Select Delivery Address" with role-specific text

#### Confirmation Phase (`components/pickup/ConfirmationPhase.jsx`)
- Title: "Pickup Request Confirmed!" â†’ "Order Confirmed!" (for buyers)
- Status messages adapt to role
- Tracking information labels

#### Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/home.jsx`)
- App name: "EcoPickup" â†’ "EcoStore" (for buyers)
- Welcome message adapts to role

#### Categories Grid (`components/sections/CategoriesGrid.jsx`)
- Toast messages: "to pickup" â†’ "to cart" (for buyers)

### 4. Backend Integration

The backend already supports the `buyer` role as documented in `BACKEND_GUIDE.md`:
- All authentication endpoints accept role parameter
- All API endpoints work for both customer and buyer roles
- No backend changes were needed

## Key Features

### Role-Based UI Customization
- **Customer Experience**: Focused on recycling, pickup scheduling, earning points
- **Buyer Experience**: Focused on shopping, placing orders, purchasing items

### Seamless User Experience
- Same screens and navigation for both roles
- Only text and messaging changes based on role
- All functionality (cart, orders, addresses, points) works for both roles

### Extensible Design
- Easy to add new roles or modify existing role behaviors
- Centralized label management makes updates simple
- Role checking utilities provide consistent behavior

## Usage Examples

### Getting Role-Specific Text
```javascript
import { getLabel } from '../utils/roleLabels';

// In component with user context
const { user } = useAuth();

// Get role-specific label
const cartTitle = getLabel('cartTitle', user?.role);
// Customer: "ðŸ›’ Your Pickup Cart"
// Buyer: "ðŸ›’ Your Shopping Cart"
```

### Role Checking
```javascript
import { isBuyer, isCustomer } from '../utils/roleLabels';

if (isBuyer(user)) {
  // Buyer-specific logic
} else if (isCustomer(user)) {
  // Customer-specific logic
}
```

## Testing the Implementation

### User Registration
1. Navigate to Register screen
2. Select "Buyer" from role dropdown
3. Complete registration process
4. Verify user is created with buyer role

### Role-Based UI
1. Login as buyer user
2. Navigate through app screens
3. Verify text shows buyer-specific labels:
   - Cart screen shows "Shopping Cart" instead of "Pickup Cart"
   - Buttons show "Place Order" instead of "Schedule Pickup"
   - Confirmation shows "Order Confirmed" instead of "Pickup Request Confirmed"

### Functionality Testing
1. Add items to cart as buyer
2. Complete order flow
3. Verify all features work identically to customer flow
4. Check that backend receives correct role information

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Buyer-Specific Features
- Different pricing structure
- Buyer-only product categories  
- Bulk ordering capabilities
- Business account features
- Different notification types

### Easy Customization Points
- All role-specific text in `utils/roleLabels.js`
- Add new roles by extending the roleLabels object
- Role-specific business logic can be added using role checking utilities

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `utils/roleLabels.js` (new file)
- `components/auth/RegisterForm.jsx`
- `app/register.jsx`
- `app/otp.jsx`

### UI Updates
- `app/(tabs)/cart.jsx`
- `app/(tabs)/home.jsx`
- `app/pickup.jsx`
- `components/pickup/AddressPhase.jsx`
- `components/pickup/ConfirmationPhase.jsx`
- `components/sections/CategoriesGrid.jsx`

All changes maintain backward compatibility and don't affect existing customer users.

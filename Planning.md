# Feature Implementation Plan: Download Order Report as PDF (Expo Go Compatible)

---

## 1. **Feature Overview**

Allow users to preview a formal, black-and-white PDF report of their pending orders from the Profile page. The report will contain all order and user info in a structured format. The feature will use Expo Go-compatible APIs, specifically `expo-print`, to generate and preview the PDF. The "Download PDF" button will only appear for pending orders in the Profile page.

---

## 2. **Project Structure Analysis**

- **Profile Page:**  
  Likely located at `app/(tabs)/profile.jsx` or similar.  
  Renders user info and lists orders, possibly with tabs for "Pending Orders", "Completed Orders", etc.

- **Order Data:**  
  Each order object should contain all necessary info (order ID, items, status, user info, etc.).

- **UI Components:**  
  Order cards or list items, with actions/buttons per order.

---

## 3. **Detailed Steps**

### 3.1. **UI Changes**

- **Locate the Pending Orders Tab:**  
  Identify the component rendering the "Pending Orders" tab in the Profile page.

- **Add "Download PDF" Button:**  
  - Render a "Download PDF" button on each order card **only if** the order status is "pending".
  - Ensure the button is visually distinct and accessible.

- **Button Press Handling:**  
  - On press, show a confirmation `Alert` asking:  
    "Do you want to preview the order report as PDF?"
  - If confirmed, proceed to PDF generation.

---

### 3.2. **PDF Generation Logic**

- **Prepare Order Data:**  
  - Gather all required order and user info for the selected order.
  - Ensure all fields are present; handle missing/undefined fields gracefully.

- **Generate HTML for PDF:**  
  - Create a function to generate a formal, black-and-white HTML template for the order report.
  - Include:
    - App logo (optional, if available as a URL or base64)
    - User name, contact info
    - Order ID, date, status
    - List of items/services in the order
    - Any relevant totals or notes
    - Footer with app contact info or disclaimer

- **Use `expo-print`:**  
  - Call `Print.printAsync({ html })` with the generated HTML.
  - This will open the system print preview dialog.

---

### 3.3. **Edge & Corner Cases**

- **Missing Data:**  
  - If any required order/user info is missing, show a user-friendly message and do not proceed to PDF generation.

- **Multiple Button Presses:**  
  - Disable the button or show a loading indicator while generating the PDF to prevent duplicate actions.

- **Unsupported Devices:**  
  - If `expo-print` is not available (very rare in Expo Go), show an error message.

- **Large Orders:**  
  - Ensure the HTML template handles long item lists gracefully (e.g., page breaks, scrollable sections).

- **Accessibility:**  
  - Ensure the button is accessible (label, touch target size).
  - Use readable fonts and high contrast in the PDF template.

---

### 3.4. **Testing Plan**

- **Manual Testing:**  
  - Test on both Android and iOS devices in Expo Go.
  - Test with orders with full data, missing fields, and long item lists.
  - Test the print preview dialog for usability.

- **Code Review:**  
  - Ensure code is modular (separate PDF template logic from UI).
  - Add comments and documentation.

---

### 3.5. **Future Enhancements (Not for Expo Go, but plan for later)**

- **Saving/Sharing PDF:**  
  - When moving to a custom dev build, add options to save or share the PDF using `expo-file-system` and `expo-sharing`.

- **Download for Completed Orders:**  
  - Optionally allow PDF download for completed orders.

- **Branding and Customization:**  
  - Add more branding, watermarks, or security features to the PDF.
